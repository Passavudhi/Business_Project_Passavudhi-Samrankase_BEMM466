Title: Predictive Analytics for Football Match Outcomes and Player Performance Using Machine Learning Methods (Student ID:730072448) This project is the part of BEMM466 Business Project Modules at University of Exeter 2023/2024


## Predicting Football Player and Squad Performance
This repository contains Python Jupyter Notebooks and associated datasets used for predicting the performance of football players and squads in upcoming seasons. The analysis leverages machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and XGBoost models, to forecast outcomes based on historical data. Below is a breakdown of the contents in this repository:

Repository Contents
### **1. Passavudhi_Predicting_Player_Performance.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook is focused on analyzing and predicting the individual performance of football players. The notebook:

Loads and processes player performance data.
Calculates metrics such as goals, assists, expected goals (xG), and expected assists (xAG) on a per 90-minute basis.
Predicts the top goal scorers and assist makers for the upcoming season.
Identifies overperformers and underperformers by comparing actual goals to expected goals.
Visualizes the results using various plots, including bar charts for the top performers.
### **2. Passvudhi_Predicting_Squad_Performance.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook aims to predict the overall performance of football squads. The notebook:

Loads and processes squad performance data across multiple seasons.
Implements machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict team points for the upcoming season.
Evaluates the model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Analyzes the importance of various features contributing to team success and visualizes the predicted standings.
### **3. Squad and Player Data File.zip
This zipped file contains the datasets used in the analysis. The datasets include cleaned and processed data for player and squad performances from recent football seasons, with features such as:

Goals scored (Gls)
Assists (Ast)
Expected Goals (xG)
Expected Assists (xAG)
Possession stats (Poss)
And other key performance indicators.
How to Use
Extract the Data: Unzip the Squad and Player Data File.zip to access the necessary CSV files.
Run the Notebooks: Open the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) and run them in sequence to reproduce the analysis and predictions.
Explore and Modify: Feel free to explore the notebooks, modify the models, or use different datasets to expand on the analysis.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization)
Scikit-learn, XGBoost (for machine learning models)
Project Overview
This project is designed to help football analysts and enthusiasts forecast player and team performance, leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques. The insights generated can assist in making strategic decisions, such as player acquisitions, game tactics, and more.
